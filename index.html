        <h2>I entered the tech field 5 years ago while living in San Francisco</h2>
        <img class="work right" src="images/work.jpg" alt="working">
        <p>I taught myself basic html & css and began building websites for friends and family while working full-time.  I also took some free part-time coding classes and eventually landed an upaid web development job.  A couple of months later, I was hired as a web developer at Gap Inc.  It was dream come true but it was a lot of work & stress as I litterally had to learn on the job.  Fortunately, my colleages and manager were incredibly supportive and wanted me to succeed.</p>
        <p>A year later, we moved to Houston.  I now work remotely as an ebook developer.  It's mostly mark-up work, but we have the opportunity to create internal tools to automate the development process.  I've created a couple of scripts for our team using JS and Node.JS but I still have a lot of learning gaps.</p>

          <li>Work on personal passion projects</li>
          <li>Find a new tech positon that best suits my skill-set and passion.</li>
